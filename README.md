Title: Enhancing Customer Retention for Shopee Thailand with Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning

Overview:
Shopee Thailand is facing challenges in retaining its user base despite high internet penetration and smartphone adoption in Southeast Asia. The current user retention rate in Thailand is approximately 37%, which is below regional counterparts. This low retention rate has significant revenue implications, exacerbated by a broad, one-size-fits-all approach to customer incentives.

Proposed Solution:
We propose a three-step framework leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning to improve customer retention and revenue for Shopee Thailand:

Data Collection: Gather real-time customer data.
Predictive Modeling: Use Random Forest algorithms on transactional and session data to assess the likelihood of churn.
Customer Segmentation: Apply K-Prototypes Clustering to identify unique customer segments for tailored marketing and sales strategies.
Monitoring: Continuously monitor and refine the tailored strategies implemented.
Data Utilized:

Two datasets with approximately 5000 entries.
Attributes include user behavior variables and customer demographics.
Key focus on churn status to inform strategic decision-making.
Limitations:

Scalability and data quality issues.
Framework serves as a guide to leverage existing systems and real-time data effectively.
Benefits:

Maximizes customer lifetime value.
Enhances revenue.
Sustains competitive edge in the Thai e-commerce market.
Adapts to evolving market dynamics and consumer preferences through continuous iteration and refinement.
By implementing this framework, Shopee Thailand can significantly improve its customer retention, enhance its revenue, and strengthen its market position in Southeast Asia.
